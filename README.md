manuscript data and analytical scripts


R script MOTE2021-Figure3and4 were utilized to analyze algal biometrics and molecular data for generating figures 3 and 4 from the manuscript. 

R script MOTE2021-Figure5and6 was utilized to compile the network analysis and generate and then test our predictive bleaching models as are shown in figures 5 and 6 of the manuscript.

All CSV files contain algal biometric, qPCR, or bleaching response dataset used in the manuscript and are directly utilized by the two R scripts above.
