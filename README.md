manuscript data and analytical scripts


R script MOTE2021-Figure2and3 were utilized to analyze algal biometrics and molecular data for generating figures 2 and 3 from the manuscript. 

R script MOTE2021-Figure4and5 was utilized to compile the network analysis and generate and then test our predictive bleaching models as are shown in figures 4 and 5 of the manuscript.

All CSV files contain algal biometric, qPCR, or bleaching response dataset used in the manuscript and are directly utilized by the two R scripts above.
